Indexing software that stores file uniqueness inside an sqlite database for easier deduplication.

I've accumulated a lot of duplicate files over the last decade, and while most
deduplication tools would allow me to deduplicate them by e.g. replacing them
by hardlinks, I'm choosing the more manual approach of identifying duplicates
as quickly as possible (by only calculating sha256 sums if there is another
file with exactly the same byte size) and then manually querying the sqlite
database for whatever it is that I need at the moment.

If I ever manage to sort this mess out, I'll let you know.
